# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create an online source to store and reference notes for the prework of this course. There are 4 main sections, HTML, CSS, GIT and JavaScript. This was done to help stay organized and also get practice with the basics of each section in preparation for the course. I learnt said basics, got to play around and start my dev journey!
